:description: Legacy endpoints.

[[http-api-legacy-endpoints]]
= Legacy Endpoints label:deprecated[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The API described in this section of the manual has been deprecated and will be removed in Neo4j 5.0.
====

For backwards compatibility with neo4j 3.5, it is still possible to
use the HTTP API without specifying the database in the URL. For example:

`http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit`.

Since the database is not specified, the statements will be executed against the user's _home database_.

All endpoints in this manual can also be executed against the legacy API where `db/<database-name>` is replaced with `db/data/transaction`. The input format and output formata are identical for both the legacy API and the current API.

For example beginning and commiting a transaction in a single requests looks as follows:

_Example request_

* *+POST+* +http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit+
* *+Accept:+* +application/json;charset=UTF-8+
* *+Content-Type:+* +application/json+
